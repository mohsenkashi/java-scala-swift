# Programming languages performance challenge


### It's a performance challenge!

First of all, make sure that *gcc* , *java* , *javac* , *scala* and *swift* commands installed and exists in your path

#### For comparing performance, code your algorithm in related files:

*c* -> **c/cTest.c**

*scala* -> **scala/scalaTest.scala**

*java*  -> **java/JavaTest.java**

*swift* -> **swfexec/Sources/main.swift**

to start benchmark use this shell script: ` $ sh start.sh `
